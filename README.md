# üñ•Ô∏è Computer Systems Architecture (ASC)

This repository contains my **Computer Systems Architecture (ASC)** assignments written in **Assembly language**, completed during my **1st year at UBB**.  
These exercises helped me understand CPU instructions, memory operations, and low-level programming concepts.
